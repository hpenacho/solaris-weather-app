                        During my studies I first started coding in C in order to grasp the basics of algorithms, before proceeding to Java and C# where I learned OOP and how to apply object-oriented principles to my projects. <br />
                        SQL server, HTML, CSS and JavaScript also became an integral part of my repertoire. <br />

                        Fast forward a year and a half of hard studying and I managed to have my internship (later hired) at Siemens after finishing my course, where I had the chance to work predominantly on Angular and React projects. <br />
                        By this time the pandemic had started, so my initial professional experience in this field was fully remote, which has had its own perks and unique challenges, but has been a very rewarding experience regardless! <br />

                    I came to understand that in order to stay relevant in this industry, one must remain a student for life. <br />
                    I took it upon myself to finish a <Link fontWeight='bold' color="inherit" rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://fullstackopen.com/en/">M.E.R.N. Stack MOOC</Link> accredited by the University of Helsinki, after work hours. <br />
                    Soon after, I felt the need to put my recently acquired knowledge to the test, and that's how this project came to be!
